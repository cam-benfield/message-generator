# InspireBot for Therapists
**Project Status: In development**

This inspirational message generator was designed to provide therapists and other mental health workers with a breath of fresh air throughout the day. If you would like to contribute, please open an issue/submit a PR and we'll be happy to help.

This message generator is written primarily in JavaScript, though that may change over time.

## Running the Script

We recommend forking your own version and cloning from there in order to avoid any conflicts from changes made during development.

## Contributing

In order to contribute, please fork the repo and submit a PR from the fork in order to allow us to best see the changes you've made. While this may not match your usual development style, this does match standards in place for many other development environments.

## Scope
This project is intended to run in the command line at the time of writing. While this may change in time, it currently is designed to return the value as a `console.log` in order to allow for future integration into various platforms.
